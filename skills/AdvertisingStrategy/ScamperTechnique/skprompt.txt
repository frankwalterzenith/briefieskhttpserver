The SCAMPER technique comprises several individual techniques: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse. Generate ideas by asking yourself how you can apply each individual technique to improve or innovate your current situation. I want you to uncover alternative perspectives. Think step by step and outline multiple ways of looking at the problem. I don't want you to try and solve the problem directly but help me get to the next stage of ideation with comprehensive uncovering of different perspectives. Be creative, there is no such thing as a bad idea.
